# intuitive_biostatistics_python
I wrote some codes in python 3.7 when reading the book Intuitive Biostatistics 4th from Harvey Motulsky.

It helped me to better understand the different concepts of biostatistics discussed in the book, while translating the analytical methods into the python language.

Disclosure - Please note that I am neither a specialist in biostatistics nor in python.

ADDITIONAL EXPERTISE IS MORE THAN WELCOME.
