# intuitive_biostatistics_python
I wrote some codes in python 3.7 and R when studying the book Intuitive Biostatistics 4th from Harvey Motulsky (OUP).

It helped me to better understand the different concepts of biostatistics discussed in the book, while translating the analytical methods into the python and R languages. The ultimate goal of that work was not only to understand deeper the concepts of the tests and analytic methods used in biological science, but also to master the tools readily available for my own projects.

Disclosure - Please note that I am neither a specialist in biostatistics nor in python.
ADDITIONAL EXPERTISE IS MORE THAN WELCOME.
