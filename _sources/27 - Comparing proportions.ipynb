    "# Comparing proportions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter embarks on an exploration of the methodologies and Python tools that empower us to analyze and interpret scenarios where outcomes are classified into **categories**. Whether we're investigating the prevalence of a disease, the effectiveness of a treatment, or the association between risk factors and outcomes, the comparison of proportions provides a statistical lens through which we can discern meaningful relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proportions, representing the _fraction of individuals or events falling into specific categories_, offer a concise and intuitive way to summarize categorical data. The comparison of proportions extends this simplicity to uncover potential disparities or associations. By examining the **differences or ratios** between proportions derived from distinct groups or conditions, we gain insights into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Disease prevalence: how does the occurrence of a condition vary across populations or over time?\n",
    "- Treatment efficacy: does a new intervention lead to a higher proportion of successful outcomes compared to a standard treatment or a control group?\n",
    "- Risk factor analysis: is there a correlation between exposure to certain factors and the likelihood of developing a specific health outcome?\n",
    "- Trend assessment: does the proportion of individuals exhibiting a particular trait change systematically across ordered categories (e.g., dosage levels in toxicology)?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will go through a versatile toolkit for comparing proportions, leveraging the capabilities of Python to perform robust analyses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contingency tables: the foundation for **organizing and visualizing** categorical relationships.\n",
    "- Fisher's Exact test: the go-to for _small sample sizes_ when comparing proportions.\n",
    "- Chi-Squared test: a powerful workhorse for _larger samples_, assessing the significance of observed differences.\n",
    "- Cochran-Armitage trend test: a specialized tool for detecting trends in proportions across **ordered categories** - particularly relevant in toxicology studies.\n",
    "- Case-control studies: a retrospective approach that investigates if past exposures are more common among individuals with a disease compared to those without.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fisher's exact test\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea of Fisher's test is to calculate the probability of obtaining the exact distribution of the data (or one more extreme) if there were truly no association between the variables (the null hypothesis H0). It does this by considering all possible ways the data could be arranged while keeping the row and column totals fixed. This allows for a precise P value calculation, even when other tests might falter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use Fisher's test\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with categorical data in biostatistics, we often find ourselves in situations where sample sizes are limited. This is where Fisher's exact test shines. Unlike other tests that rely on approximations (which may not be accurate with small samples), Fisher's test provides an exact calculation of the probability of observing the data (or something more extreme) under the null hypothesis of no association.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher's test is particularly well-suited for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Small sample sizes: if the contingency table has cells with expected counts less than 5, Fisher's test is often the preferred choice.\n",
    "- Rare events: when we're dealing with outcomes that occur infrequently, Fisher's test is more reliable than tests that rely on large-sample assumptions.\n",
    "- 2x2 tables: while Fisher's test can be extended to larger tables, it's most commonly used for situations with two categorical variables, each having two levels (e.g., treatment vs. control, success vs. failure).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contingency table\n",
    "\n",
    "A contingency table is a structured way to organize the results of a study where both the predictor (e.g., treatment or exposure) and the outcome are categorical. Rows typically correspond to the different levels of the predictor, while columns represent the different possible outcomes. The values within the table show the **count** of subjects falling into each combination of predictor and outcome. We can use [`scipy.stats.contingency` functions](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.contingency.html) or [`pandas.crosstab`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.crosstab.html) to create and analyze contingency tables."

    "### Confidence intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sections, we've explored several key measures for comparing proportions: ARR, NNT, RR, and OR. However, these values are just point estimates derived from our sample data. To truly understand the reliability of these estimates and draw meaningful conclusions about the broader population, we need to consider their confidence intervals (CIs).\n",
    "\n",
    "A confidence interval provides a _range of plausible values for a population parameter_ (like ARR, NTT, RR, or OR) based on the sample data. It tells us how confident we can be that the true population value falls within that range. A 95% confidence interval, for example, means that if we were to repeat our study many times, we would expect _95% of the calculated intervals to contain the true population value_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence intervals are crucial for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Estimating precision: they quantify the uncertainty surrounding our point estimates. A wider CI indicates more uncertainty, while a narrower CI suggests greater **precision**.\n",
    "- Statistical significance: if a CI for a measure like RR or OR does not include 1, it typically indicates a *statistically significant association* between the exposure and outcome.\n",
    "- Clinical relevance: CIs help us assess the practical importance of our findings. A wide CI around a large RR might suggest that the effect could be clinically meaningful, even if the exact magnitude is uncertain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods for calculating confidence intervals vary depending on the specific measure (ARR, NNT, RR, OR) and the underlying statistical assumptions, e.g., normal approximation (a simple approach that works for large samples), exact methods (more accurate for smaller samples), and bootstrapping (a versatile resampling technique that can be applied to various scenarios), though they are typically calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{CI}^{1 - \\alpha} = \\hat{\\theta} \\pm c^\\ast \\times s_{\\hat{\\theta}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\text{CI}^{1 - \\alpha}$ represents the confidence interval at $1 - \\alpha$ confidence level, $\\hat{\\theta}$ the point estimate of the population parameter, $c^\\ast$ the critical value from the relevant distribution corresponding to the desired confidence level and if relevant, given degrees of freedom, e.g., t-distribution ($t_{\\alpha/2, df}$), standard normal ($z_{\\alpha/2}$), etc., and $s_{\\hat{\\theta}}$ the standard error (SE) of the point estimate."

    "As discussed in our earlier chapter on confidence intervals for proportions, several methods can be employed to estimate the CI around the proportion of patients experiencing disease progression. In this analysis, we'll focus on the proportion of patients with disease progression in both the placebo group (73 out of 829) and the apixaban-treated group (14 out of 840). Let's utilize the 'normal' method available in the `statsmodels.stats.proportion` module for this calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal approximation is considered valid when the sample size is sufficiently large. A common rule of thumb is that both of the following conditions should hold: $n \\times p \\ge 5$ and $n \\times (1 - p) \\ge 5$. _The underlying true proportion is not too close to 0 or 1. If the proportion is very close to either extreme, other methods like the [Wilson score interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval) might be more appropriate._"

    "While the RR provides a valuable point estimate for the comparison of risks between two groups, it's essential to acknowledge the inherent uncertainty associated with any estimate derived from sample data. To address this uncertainty, we turn to confidence intervals (CIs), which provide a range of plausible values for the true population RR.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence intervals for RR are crucial for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assessing precision: they indicate how precise our estimate of the RR is. A wider CI suggests greater uncertainty, while a narrower CI reflects a more precise estimate.\n",
    "- Statistical significance: if the CI for RR does not include 1 (the value indicating no association), it suggests a statistically significant association between the exposure and outcome.\n",
    "- Clinical relevance: CIs help gauge the practical importance of the observed association. A statistically significant RR might not be clinically meaningful if the CI includes values close to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional formula for the CI of RR is $\\text{CI} = \\text{RR} \\pm z^\\ast \\times s_\\text{RR}$, where $\\text{RR}$ is the relative risk, $z^\\ast$ the critical z-value corresponding to the desired level of confidence (e.g., 1.96 for a 95% CI), and $s_\\text{RR}$ the standard error of the relative risk, often approximated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_\\text{RR} \\approx \\text{RR} \\times \\sqrt{1/a \\times b/n_1 + 1/c \\times d/n_2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a more accurate approach to calculating the CI for RR is based on the log transformation. This approach takes advantage of the fact that the logarithm of the RR tends to follow a normal distribution, especially for large sample sizes. Then we calculate the standard error of log(RR) as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "s_{\\log{\\text{RR}}} &= \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(\\log{\\text{RR}})} \\\\\n",

    "In toxicology studies, where the paramount goal is to assess the safety of a test article (TA), e.g., a new drug, minimizing the risk of false negatives - incorrectly concluding a TA is safe when it's not - must be the central concern throughout the study's design, analysis, and interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data from toxicology studies frequently consist of event counts, such as the number of tumors observed in two treatment groups: treated with a TA and control. These counts can be easily organized into contingency tables, making Fisher's exact test a relevant statistical tool for analyzing such data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common scenario is testing the hypothesis that the tumor rate in a treated group is equal to that in a control group, i.e., there is no treatment effect, against the alternative hypothesis that the tumor rate is higher in the treated group. We perform a **one-sided test** to specifically assess whether the odds of tumor development are significantly greater in the treated group compared to the control group (i.e., OR > 1). Fisher's exact test is particularly suitable when the number of observations in the contingency table is small, as it provides an exact P value without relying on large-sample approximations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although some statistical software packages may lack a dedicated function for Fisher's exact test, it's readily available in Python using the `fisher_exact` function from the SciPy package, as we've demonstrated earlier in this chapter."

    "The chi-squared ($\\chi^2$) test stands as a cornerstone in the analysis of **categorical data**. It's a versatile statistical tool used to examine the relationship between two categorical variables, answering the question of whether there's a significant association between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chi-squared test's versatility stems from its ability to handle various types of contingency tables, not just the 2x2 tables commonly analyzed with Fisher's exact test. Whether we're dealing with multiple groups, multiple outcomes, or a combination of both, the chi-squared test can adapt to the data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This test is particularly powerful when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comparing multiple groups: we want to assess whether the distribution of an outcome differs significantly across multiple groups or categories.\n",
    "- Investigating complex associations: we're interested in exploring associations between multiple categorical variables, beyond simple 2x2 relationships.\n",
    "- Large sample sizes: when the sample size is sufficiently large, the chi-squared test provides a reliable way to assess the statistical significance of observed associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "The core principle of the chi-squared test lies in comparing the **observed** frequencies in the contingency table to the **expected** frequencies if there were no association between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Observed frequencies: the actual counts of individuals falling into each category combination in the data.\n",
    "- Expected frequencies: the counts we would expect to see in each category if the null hypothesis (no association) were true. These are calculated based on the marginal totals of the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "It quantifies the discrepancy between these two sets of frequencies and assesses whether this discrepancy is likely due to chance or reflects a genuine association. The key steps involved are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Formulate hypotheses\n",
    "    - Null hypothesis (H0): there is no association between the two categorical variables.\n",
    "    - Alternative hypothesis (H1): there is an association between the variables.\n",
    "2. Calculate expected frequencies: under the null hypothesis of independence, calculate the expected frequency for each cell in the contingency table.\n",
    "3. Calculate chi-squared statistic: this statistic measures the overall discrepancy between observed and expected frequencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(\\text{Observed} - \\text{Expected})^2}{\\text{Expected}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine P value: the P value quantifies the probability of observing a chi-squared statistic as extreme as (or more extreme than) the one calculated, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "2. Interpret results: if the P value is small (typically below 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is evidence of a statistically significant association between the variables."

When Mendel self-fertilized the F1 plants, he observed the following phenotypes in the second generation (F2):\n",

    "In a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test, the degrees of freedom are simply the number of categories minus 1. In the case of Mendel's pea experiment, there are 4 categories (round yellow, round green, wrinkled yellow, wrinkled green), so the degrees of freedom would be 3. They represent the number of categories whose frequencies can vary freely, given the constraint that the total number of observations is fixed. Once we know the frequencies of all but one category, the frequency of the remaining category is automatically determined."

    "### Chi-squared test of independence\n",
    "\n",
    "In this specific case, both seed shape and seed color have two categories each, resulting in a 2x2 (two rows by two columns) contingency table. The chi-squared test is often used to analyze 2x2 tables to determine if there is a significant association between the two categorical variables. Chi-squared tests can be applied to tables with more than two rows or columns, allowing us to analyze relationships between variables with multiple categories. In some cases, we might have a single row representing a categorical variable with multiple categories. We can still use the chi-squared test to compare the observed frequencies in each category to expected frequencies based on some theoretical distribution.\n",

    "The [`mosaic` function within the `statsmodels.graphics.mosaicplot` module](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.graphics.mosaicplot.mosaic.html) creates a mosaic plot, a powerful graphical representation of contingency tables that visualizes the relative frequencies of combinations of categories within a contingency table, the area of each rectangle in the plot being directly _proportional to the frequency_ of the corresponding category combination. Mosaic plots can effectively display relationships between multiple categorical variables, revealing hierarchical relationships between variables, and highlighting how the distribution of one variable changes depending on the levels of another variable."

    "#### Interpreting the results of the chi-squared test of independence\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`scipy.stats.chi2_contingency` function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.chi2_contingency.html) performs the chi-squared test of independence for contingency tables. It's designed to assess whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables. It takes a contingency table (a 2D array or list of lists) as input, representing the observed frequencies of the categories. It returns the χ² test statistic, the P value of the test, the degrees of freedom and the expected frequencies under the null hypothesis of independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `chi2_contingency` function doesn't inherently know about Mendel's laws of inheritance or any specific biological mechanism. It calculates expected values based on a purely statistical assumption: independence between the categorical variables. The function first calculates the row and column totals of the observed contingency table. These totals represent the **marginal frequencies** of each category for each variable. It then calculates the expected proportion for each cell in the table under the assumption of independence. This is done by multiplying the corresponding row proportion and column proportion and dividing by the total number of observations. Finally, the expected frequencies are obtained by multiplying the expected proportions by the total number of observations."

    "\n",
    "In a chi-squared test of independence, the degrees of freedom represent the number of cells in the contingency table that can vary freely _once the marginal totals (row and column sums) are fixed_. It's a measure of how much flexibility or \"wiggle room\" the data has within the constraints of the fixed totals. For a contingency table with r rows and c columns, the degrees of freedom are calculated as DF = (r - 1) * (c - 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Mendel's pea experiment, while there are 4 phenotype categories, the underlying genetic model (his laws of inheritance) imposes constraints on how the data can be distributed. Once we know the total number of plants and the expected proportions based on Mendel's laws, we can determine the expected frequency for three of the cells. The fourth cell's expected frequency is then automatically determined to maintain the correct marginal totals.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a 2x2 table (2 rows for seed color and 2 columns for seed shape), so the degrees of freedom are 1. Imagine we have a 2x2 table with the marginal totals, once we fill in one cell, the rest of the cells are automatically determined due to the fixed marginal totals. We only _had the freedom_ to choose the value of one cell; the rest were constrained. Hence, the degrees of freedom in this case are 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The degrees of freedom in a chi-squared test reflect the number of independent pieces of information in the data that are available to estimate the parameters of interest.  It's not simply the number of categories, but rather the number of categories that can vary freely given the constraints imposed by the marginal totals and any underlying model."

    "## Cochran-Armitage test for trend\n",
    "\n",
    "While the chi-squared test assesses general associations between _categorical variables_, the [Cochran-Armitage trend test (also known as the trend test)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochran%E2%80%93Armitage_test_for_trend) is a specialized tool designed to detect linear trends in proportions across **ordinal categories**. This test is particularly valuable in biostatistics, especially in toxicology and dose-response studies, where we often want to determine if there's a relationship between increasing doses or exposure levels and the probability of a specific outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the trend test works\n",
    "\n",
    "The trend test essentially assigns scores to each category of the ordinal variable (e.g., 1, 2, 3 for low, medium, high dose) and then calculates a weighted chi-squared statistic. This weighted statistic takes into account the ordering of the categories, making it sensitive to linear trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trend test is most appropriate when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ordinal categories: the data involves a binary outcome (e.g., presence/absence of disease) and an explanatory variable with ordered categories (e.g., increasing dose levels: low, medium, high).\n",
    "- Linear trend suspected: we suspect that the proportion of the outcome changes in a linear fashion across the ordered categories. For example, we might hypothesize that the risk of disease increases with higher doses of a toxin.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trend test is more powerful than the standard chi-squared test when a linear trend truly exists. This means it's more likely to detect a real association when one is present. Moreover, it specifically tests for a linear trend, making it more focused than the general chi-squared test, which only assesses whether there's any association. Finally, the trend test is ideally suited for dose-response studies, where the goal is to understand how the effect of a substance changes with increasing exposure levels.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the previous sections, we've explored methods for analyzing data from cross-sectional and prospective studies, where we often have access to incidence rates or risk information directly. Case-control studies, however, present a different paradigm. These studies are **retrospective**, meaning they start with individuals who already have the outcome of interest (cases) and those who don't (controls). The goal is to look back in time to assess whether exposure to a particular risk factor differs between the two groups. Though, they are prone to certain biases, such as recall bias (cases might remember their exposure history differently than controls) and selection bias (the way cases and controls are selected might not be representative of the underlying population).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical analysis in case-control studies\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike cohort studies, case-control studies are designed retrospectively, starting with individuals who already have the disease (cases) and those who don't (controls). This structure means that the proportion of cases in the study doesn't reflect the true disease prevalence in the population. Consequently, we cannot directly calculate risks or relative risks (RR) from case-control data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, case-control studies utilize the odds ratio (OR) as their primary measure of association. The OR compares the odds of exposure (e.g., vaccination) among cases to the odds of exposure among controls.  Mathematically, it's the ratio of the odds of cases being exposed to the odds of controls being exposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistical tools we've discussed so far are still relevant, but their interpretation and application need to be adapted for case-control designs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fisher's exact test can still be used in case-control studies, especially when the sample size is _small_ or the contingency table has low expected frequencies. However, it's important to remember that Fisher's test provides a P value for testing the null hypothesis of no association, but it doesn't directly estimate the relative risk.\n",
    "- For larger sample sizes, the chi-squared test can be used as an alternative to Fisher's exact test for testing the association between the exposure and outcome in a case-control study. Again, the chi-squared test doesn't directly provide the RR, but it does give a P value to assess statistical significance.\n",
    "- The Cochran-Armitage test is generally not applicable to case-control studies because it's designed for prospective studies where we follow individuals over time to observe the development of an outcome. In case-control studies, we're looking back in time at exposure history, not tracking the development of new cases."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we've embarked on a journey through the world of comparing proportions—a cornerstone of biostatistical analysis. We've explored a wide array of tools and techniques, from foundational contingency tables to powerful statistical tests, each designed to unveil patterns and associations hidden within categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We began with Fisher's exact test, a precise method for analyzing small sample sizes and rare events. We then delved into the versatile chi-squared test, capable of handling larger tables and assessing deviations from expected frequencies. We further refined our toolkit with the Cochran-Armitage trend test, designed to detect trends in ordinal data, particularly useful in toxicological studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we explored essential concepts like attributable risk, relative risk, odds ratio, and number needed to treat, equipping us with the language and understanding to quantify the impact of exposures and treatments. We learned how to construct confidence intervals for these measures, acknowledging and embracing the uncertainty inherent in statistical estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we turned our attention to case-control studies, a powerful observational design for exploring associations in retrospective data. We discovered the importance of the odds ratio in this context and how it can approximate the relative risk under certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this chapter, we've emphasized the importance of selecting the right statistical tool for the job. The choice of test depends on the study design, data characteristics, and research questions. While some tests are more versatile than others, each has its own strengths and limitations. Understanding these nuances is crucial for conducting rigorous and reliable analyses. For example, smaller sample sizes might require exact tests (like Fisher's) or adjustments (like Yates' correction), while larger samples can often rely on approximations (like the chi-squared test).\n",
    "\n",
    "We've learned how to harness the power of Python to perform these analyses, using libraries like `scipy.stats` and `statsmodels`. We've seen how these tools can be applied to real-world problems, from assessing the efficacy of treatments to analyzing dose-response relationships in toxicology studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we conclude this chapter, it's crucial to remember that statistics are more than just numbers. They are lenses through which we interpret data, helping us make sense of complex phenomena and inform decision-making. However, statistical results should always be interpreted in context."
