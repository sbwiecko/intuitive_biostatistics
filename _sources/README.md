# Python Companion Guide to "Intuitive Biostatistics"

I am thrilled to unveil a project that I embarked on a few years ago. I am confident it will intrigue any wet-lab scientist aiming to bolster their proficiency in biostatistics and datascience, ultimately leading to a deeper comprehension of their own research or studies published by others.

The initial idea behind this project was to dissect, digest and expand upon the concepts found in the excellent book ["Intuitive Biostatistics 4th Edition" by Harvey Motulsky](https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/intuitive-biostatistics-9780190643560), that I highly suggest to anyone who is ready to delve into this daunting realm...

My intention was not to reproduce the book, but to deepen my understanding of biostatistics by actively engaging with the material. The analyses were conducted mainly using Python, sometimes R, and I included practical illustrations and supplementary research to reinforce the ideas presented in the book.

All of this work was initially done in a rather rough manner using notebooks and dirty scripts, but I felt the need to share it with (next generation) scientists, with a higher degree of professionalism. Consequently, I've initiated a [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) that showcases various features.

## Features

- **Illustrative code**, with practical examples of the statistical methods mentioned in the book, implemented in Python and R.
- **Detailed calculations**, involving a comprehensive step-by-step explanation of how these methods function at their core.
- **Extended research**, including an in-depth investigation of related subjects not discussed in the book, particularly utilizing data from my own experiments.
- **Supplementary equations and information** that have assisted me in understanding certain concepts and delving further into others.

## How to Use This Guide

This Jupyter Book is designed to complement "Intuitive Biostatistics, 4th edition" book, focusing on the interactive aspects of biostatistics through code examples and visualizations. To enhance the learning, some chapters from the original book have been combined where the content naturally flows together.  Please note that introductory chapters primarily focused on theoretical concepts have not been included here; you can find those in the original text.

For each chapter or concept in the book that requires concrete calculations or graphical representation, refer to the corresponding section in this guide for practical examples, additional studies, and supplementary information.
